STM32:
Peripheral drivers are frequently updated by silicon vendors. Maintaining the
target support for thousands of microcontrollers would be a tremendously
time-consuming task. We therefore recommend all STM32 developers to use the
STM32CubeMX code generator to generate the latest versions of drivers, stacks
and middleware for your project.

STM32CubeMX integrates in to Atollic TrueSTUDIO seamlessly.

Read our application note on how to integrate STM32CubeMX with
Atollic TrueSTUDIO here:

After installation normally STM32F4xx HAL driver can be found in a folder.
C:\Users\Name\STM32Cube\Repository\STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.10.0\Drivers\STM32F4xx_HAL_Driver


Please note!
The STM32Cube firmware package also includes many project examples for different
STM32 Discovery/Nucleo/EVAL boards prepared for Atollic TrueSTUDIO.
E.g. STM32F4-Discovery GPIO Example
C:\Users\ASW-EJ\STM32Cube\Repository\STM32Cube_FW_F4_V1.10.0\Projects\STM32F4-Discovery\Examples\GPIO\GPIO_EXTI\TrueSTUDIO\STM32F4-Discovery
Double click on a .project file to open the example in Atollic TrueSTUDIO.
